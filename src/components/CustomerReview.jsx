They did everything within the timeframe they gave as well as made sure that the things we left in the car, are all in a bag. They also uninstalled and cleaned out our infant seat attachment. Will definately go back again. Thank you!',

So I trusted everyone else\'s reviews and picked action, the price was right very polite and my car is coated perfectly. I actually waited a few weeks for our Winnipeg weather to hit it and see how it washes off. Seeing the beads of water beat off, that\'s what you can call it,, makes you feel good..... A year later... went there for a ceramic coating warranty check and touch-up. Car came out looking like a shiny diamond. Great work!',
